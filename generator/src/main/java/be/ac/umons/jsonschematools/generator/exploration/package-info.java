/**
 * Contains a generator that produces documents by exhaustively exploring the JSON schema.
 * 
 * With the default value handlers, the produced documents have abstracted values.
 * For instance, integer values are all represented by the special symbol {@code \I}.
 * See {@link be.ac.umons.jsonschematools.AbstractConstants} for all abstract values, and the <a href="https://docskellington.github.io/JSONSchemaTools/structure.html#generating-numbers-integers-strings-and-enumeration-values">non-API documentation</a> for more information.
